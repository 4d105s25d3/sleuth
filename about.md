__sleuth__ is a program for analysis of RNA-Seq experiments for which transcript abundances have been quantified with kallisto. __sleuth__ provides tools for exploratory data analysis utilizing Shiny, and implements statistical algorithms for differential analysis that leverage the boostrap estimates of kallisto.

The __sleuth__ project was developed by [Harold
Pimentel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pimentel/) with assistance from [Nicolas
Bray](https://math.berkeley.edu/~nbray/), [PÃ¡ll
Melsted](https://notendur.hi.is/pmelsted/) and [Lior
Pachter](https://math.berkeley.edu/~lpachter/). A preprint with more details about the program will be available shortly. 

To use __sleuth__ [download the software](download.html) and visit the
[Getting started](starting.html) page for a quick tutorial.
