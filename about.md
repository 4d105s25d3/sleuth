__sleuth__ is a program for analysis of RNA-Seq experiments for which transcript abundances have been quantified with [kallisto](http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto).
__sleuth__ provides tools for exploratory data analysis utilizing [Shiny by RStudio](http://shiny.rstudio.com), and implements statistical algorithms for differential analysis that leverage the boostrap estimates of [kallisto](http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto).
A <a href="http://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/08/17/a-sleuth-for-rna-seq/">companion blogpost</a> has more information about __sleuth__; a preprint with details of the method is forthcoming.

The __sleuth__ project was developed by [Harold Pimentel](https://pimentel.github.io) with assistance from [Nicolas Bray](https://math.berkeley.edu/~nbray/), [PÃ¡ll Melsted](https://notendur.hi.is/pmelsted/) and [Lior Pachter](https://math.berkeley.edu/~lpachter/).
A preprint with more details about the program is available from the bioRxiv:
